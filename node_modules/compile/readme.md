Compiled
========

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/sorensen/compiled.png)](http://travis-ci.org/sorensen/compiled) 

Class / function composition library, combines all static and prototype methods
into a single function, constructors are also chained and will be ran in the 
order they are received. A `strict` option can be set for the library which will
throw an error if property colision is encountered.

This library can be used with both node and the browser, file based methods are
only available in node, such as `compile.dir`.


Usage
-----

Node.js

``` js
var compile = require('compile')
```

Browser

``` html
<script src="compile.min.js"></script>
```


Methods
-------

### compile(â€¦)

Combines any number of functions passed into a single function

``` js
function Red() { this.bar = 1 }
function Blue() { this.foo = 2 }

var Purple = compile(Red, Blue)
var purp = new Purple()

purp.bar // 1
purp.foo // 2
```

### compile.setup(options)

Configure the library, currently only the `strict` option is used, which will 
throw an error if a property colision is found.

``` js
compile.setup({ strict: true })
```

### compile.dir(directory, [exclude])

Combines all exports for a given directory into a single function, `directory`
should be the absolute path, `exclude` can be an array of filenames or a single
file to exclude from the compile. Pathing can be relative or absolute for `exclude`.

``` js
module.exports = compile.dir(__dirname, __filename)
```


Install
-------
